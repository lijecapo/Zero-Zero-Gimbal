9. 4x [F625ZZ bearings](https://amzn.to/47mWnvR)
10. [10mm aluminium rod](https://amzn.to/4qlifAq), you can take one with a bigger inner diameter to allow cables for a connector to pass through 
11. (optionnal) [Aluminium sleeve](https://amzn.to/47z65ML) i used to reinforce the top part
12. [M2 screws](https://amzn.to/3IWEvQl)

15. 4x Laser cutted metal brackets

Note: You will also need tools, such as a metal saw and a vice or some sort of press. And a drill if you go with the 28mm Aluminium Sleeve reinforcement. If you decide to skip it, you will need to adjust the diameter of the stick adaptor OR the gimbal stick connector itself
